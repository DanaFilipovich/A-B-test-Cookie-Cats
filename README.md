# A-B-test-Cookie-Cats
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/cookiecatsgame">Cookie Cats</a> is a hugely popular mobile puzzle game developed by <a href="http://tactile.dk">Tactile Entertainment</a>. It's a classic "connect three"-style puzzle game where the player must connect tiles of the same color to clear the board and win the level. It also features singing cats. </p>
<p>As players progress through the levels of the game, they will occasionally encounter gates that force them to wait a non-trivial amount of time or make an in-app purchase to progress. In addition to driving in-app purchases, these gates serve the important purpose of giving players an enforced break from playing the game, hopefully resulting in that the player's enjoyment of the game being increased and prolonged.</p>

Where should the gates be placed? 
Initially the first gate was placed at level 30. 
</p><strong>The goal of analysis: estimate the impact on 1- and 7-day player retention if the first gate will be moved from level 30 to level 40.<strong></p>
